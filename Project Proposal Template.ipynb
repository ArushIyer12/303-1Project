    "3. Use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html) to print the *.ipynb* file as HTML. You will need to open the command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the file, and use the command: `quarto render filename.ipynb --to html`. Submit the HTML file.\n",

If you have too many variables, some of which are  correlated or collinear, you may need to do variable selection *(techniques for variable selection that you will learn later in the course - stepwise regression, lasso, ridge regression)*. If the variables do not have a linear relationship with the response, or if some of the modeling assumptions are not satisfied, you may need to transform the predictors and/or the response (variable transformation) to obtain a better fit.\n",
