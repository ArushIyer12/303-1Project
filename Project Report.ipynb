    "**Abstract**: *On average, Algeria experiences 1,636 forest fires every year [1]. These forest fires burn 35,024 ha of forest lands annually [1]. Scientists have also determined that forest fires explain 90% of Algerian forest land degradation[1]. The majority of these fires (80%) are of unknown origin, making them difficult to anticipate[1]. Our goal was to create a model that will accurately predict the chance of a forest fire occurring based on climate data. A major stakeholder for this project is the Algerian government. Reducing forest fires has been a major governmental initiative, especially since devastating fires in early 2022[1]. Our model could help inform more efficient wildfire management programs. Additional stakeholders include the Algerian people and numerous wildlife organizations and researchers. We developed a logistic regression model that uses interactions between climate and forest fire index predictors that does not fail to predict a forest fire when one occurs (100% recall). We recommend stakeholders optimize data collection of the predictors used in our model and employ a similar model to inform wildfire preparation efforts and processes.*"

    "Our goal was to create a model that uses climate data to predict the likelihood of a forest fire occuring. This is a classification problem and our main goal was prediction.

This informed our model building philosophy."

    "The data source used in this project is the Algerian Forest Fires Dataset Data Set, and it is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It is a multivariate data set with 244 instances of whether a fire occured or not on a specific day in the period from June 2012 to September 2012, across two regions in Northern Algeria, Bejaia region in the northeast and the Sidi Bel-abbes region in the northwest. It has 12 variables in total, including 6 indexes from the Fire Weather Index (FWI) system, a unitless system widely used to measure  general fire intensity potential. Such variables are as follows with the scales in which they can be at minimum or maximum:\n",
    "- Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC): 28.6 to 92.5\n",
    "- Duff Moisture Code (DMC): 1.1 to 65.9\n",
    "- Drought Code (DC): 7 to 220.4\n",
    "- Initial Spread Index (ISI): 0 to 18.5\n",
    "- Buildup Index (BUI): 1.1 to 68\n",
    "- Fire Weather Index (FWI): 0 to 31.1\n",
    "- Temp (at noon) in Celsius: 22 to 42\n",
    "- Relative Humidity (RH) in %: 21 to 90 \n",
    "- Wind speed (Ws) in km/h: 6 to 29 \n",
    "- Rain (total day) in mm: 0 to 16.8\n",
    "\n",
    "In our analysis, we found that using day or month as a function of analysis was almost useless, and thus excluded it from our model. Additionally, we had to take into consideration the collinearity in our data. With the FWI system, many of the variables are derived from the same variables. The FFMC is derived from Temp, RH, Wind, and Rain. The ISI is derived from FFMC and Wind. Then, the DMC is based on Temp, RH, and Rain. DC is derived from Temperature and Rain only. Then, DC and DMC are what the BUI is derived from. Finally, ISI and BUI is what FWI is based on. So, dealing with these variables stacking from each other, we took this collinearity into consideration when creating our model.\n"

    "Being able to accurate predict forest fires will allow the Algerian government to properly appropriate funds and staff members to the places and groups that need it most, since they can easily predict whether there is or isn't a fire. This model will allow the Algerian people to live a bit more peacefully, since they will not have the stress of misidentifying a fire. Fires will be accurately predicted and these stakeholders will rest easy knowing that if the model does not class certain indexes as a fire, there actually isn't a fire.\n",
    "As climate change becomes a more and more important topic in today's world, local and even international wildlife and climate groups will benefit from this model. With this classification model, and its increased use, these organizations will be able to learn about trends within this region and more broadly, within the continent. "

    "The code represented below is necessary to demonstrate the distribution of values of each variable in tabular form, before and data cleaning occured. From the data quality check, we found that there were only two rows with missing values. One of the rows that had missing values was simply a row utilized for labelling by the publisher of the data. They used it to show that Rows 1-122 is from Bejaia, Row 123 onwards is Sidi Bel-abbes. We decided to drop that row and then create a new column that labelled the Regions numerically, Region 1 as Bejaia and Region 2 as Sidi Bel-abbes. The other missing row was missing data, but since it was only one row, and the data was really consistent and clean, we decided to drop it. Afterwards, we had to clean some of the data inputs for \"no fire\" and \"fire\". Many of them had odd, unecessary spacing issues, so we took out the spaces and then assigned dummy variables for \"no fire\" and \"fire\", being 0 and 1 respectively. Then, the dataypes needed to be converted data types to workable, numerical data types. Finally, we created the test and train sets, utilizing 0.3 test and 0.7 train, as it seemed to create the best performance result for the set. "

    "We used a logistic approach as it was a classification problem. We chose to optimize for recall rather than precision or accuracy. This was due to the context of our problem. In our opinion, it is better for our model to cause a false alarm (i.e. predict a fire when none occurs) than fail to predict a fire when one actually occurs. In the latter case, people would be completely blindsided by the fire and the damage done would be much worse. When optimizing our model using forward and backward stepwise selection, we picked the model with the lowest AIC as opposed to BIC. This is because we wanted our model to be less conservative for the reasons mentioned above.\n",

As mentioned above, a lot of our predictors (especially the FWI indexes) are derived from the same \"base\" climate variables (temperature, rain, humidity, etc...). As such, we anticpated and experienced severe collinearity between our predictors. Our initial thought was to perform a VIF test (seen below) and select variables where the VIF test was below 5. This ended up changing for reasons that will be explained in the \"Developing the Model\" section.\n",

    "It is somewhat difficult to outline policy-based recommendations for stakeholders. The purpose of this model was simply to serve as a tool for predicting wildfires. One key takeaway is that a combination of climate variables are relevant to whether or not a fire occurs, not single variables. In our model, we used many interaction terms between different climate variables. Additionally, we found that temperature not as significant as rain (or rather the lack thereof) and relative humidity in determining whether or not there will be a fire. Finally, time variables (such as day, month, and year) are not very important for predicting fires. When we tested adding them into the model, it significantly reduced our recall and thus we left them out. We would recommend that stakeholders optimize the collection of climate variables to ensure that predictive models such as ours can be as accurate as possible. "
